# Payroll Management System (Python)

This is a attempt of me, to create a basic payroll management system using Python and MySQL

A User can add,view,delete,modify records and can view as well as generate the payroll of a employee/employees

## Prerequisites
### You need to have the following modules installed on your system
* tabulate
* mysql-connector-python
* pandas

#### to install a module (to be run in your terminal/cmd/shell)
```
pip install {module_name}
```

### Remember: Change the password in the code, to yours which you have in your MySQL Server

## Notes:
3/12/22 - Added Export as CSV (Payroll)
