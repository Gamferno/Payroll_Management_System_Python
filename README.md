# Payroll Management System (Python)

This is a attempt of me, to create a basic payroll management system in Python

A User can add,view,delete,modify records and can view the payroll of a employee/employees

## Prerequisites
### You need to have the following modules installed on your system
* tabulate
* mysql-connecter-python

#### to install a module : pip install {module_name} (in your cmd/terminal)

Note: I may add a Export to CSV in the future
